/*
  Singleton Design Pattern--->
	  It will create only one instance of class.

We want to create only one instance Then Follow this steps-->

Step 1: Create the object of class- private static

Step 2: Create the private constructor

Step 3: Create the public static method which return class object

Step 4: With the help of multithreading we may create multiple object
		Syncronized block.There may be chance to clone the object
		
Step 5: Still we may copy the object by using clone method.
	    throw CloneNotSupportedExecption.

        Still by using serialization we can create multiple object 
        of class.override readResolve();
