//	Input and output stream in java----->

//	Java I/O (Input and Output) is used to process the input and produce the output.
//	Java uses the concept of a stream to make I/O operation fast. The java.io package contains all the classes required for input and output operations.
//	We can perform file handling in Java by Java I/O API.


//	Stream----->
//	A stream is a sequence of data. In Java, a stream is composed of bytes. 

//	In Java, 3 streams are created for us automatically. All these streams are attached with the console.
//	1) System.out: standard output stream, that is used to produce the result of a program on an output device like the computer screen.
//	2) System.in: standard input stream, that is used to read characters from the keyboard or any other standard input device.
//	3) System.err: standard error stream, that is used to output all the error data that a program might throw, on a computer screen or any standard output device.
//
//
//
//Output Stream:---->
//Java application uses an output stream to write data to a destination; it may be a file, an array, peripheral device or socket.
//
//
//
//Input Stream:------>
//Java application uses an input stream to read data from a source; it may be a file, an array, peripheral device or socket.
//Let's understand the working of Java OutputStream and InputStream by the figure given below as-
