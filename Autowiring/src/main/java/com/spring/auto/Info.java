/* Autowiring-
	
	Why?
	Suppose I have two classes Employee and address both are the dependent 
	on each other so in that case we should go for autowiring concepts.
	
	What is Autowiring?
	Autowiring feature of spring framework enables you to inject the object
	dependency implicitly.
	
	
	Note- 
	1.	We can inject only secondary types. 
	2.	Autowiring can not apply to primitives types. 
	    Spring container will take care of automatic dependency injection.
	3.	You can apply autowiring through constructor or setter method.
	
	
	
	There are several types of autowiring are as follows:-->
	1)	ByType-(internally it uses setter base injection
	2)	ByName--(internally it uses setter base injection)
	3)	Constructor-(internally it uses constructor base injection)
	4)	autodetect-(it uses both setter and constructor base injection
