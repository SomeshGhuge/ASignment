	 * Dependency checking-
It is used to check whether the required properties have been set or 
injected called as dependency checking.

Why?
It is not mandatory to pass the value through setter dependency injection 
but if you want to make setter base injection compulsory.
 There is one concepts called as “Dependency checking”.
 
Note- 

1.	Constructor dependency injection is mandatory because it is compulsory
    to pass the value into parameterized constructor then it will find the 
    parameterized constructor in your class and it will create the objects.
 
2.	Default scope of dependency checking is “None”, 
    It is not mandatory to call setter methods.
    
    
There are following types of dependency checking.
	simple
	objects
	all
	none


1. Simple-
If you set dependency checking to simple then it is mandatory to call primitives types setter methods.
