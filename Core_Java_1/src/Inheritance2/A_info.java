	//Types of inheritance---->
	
	
	// 1)Single inheritance--->It is simply, One child & One parent relationship.
	
	
	// 2) Multilevel inheritance--->It has only one base class and multiple derived class. 
	//It refers to the concept of one class extending (Or inherits) more than one base class. 
	//Multilevel Inheritance is when a superclass is inherited by an intermediate class.
	//which is then inherited by a derived class, forming 3 or more levels of inheritance.

	
	
	// 3) Multiple inheritance--->	When a single subclass inherits from multiple parent classes is known as Multiple inheritance.
	//  Multiple inheritance is not possible in Java.

	
	// 4)Hybride inheritance ----> 
	
	
   //5)Hierarchical inheritance---->
   //---->One class is inherited by many sub classes called as hierarchical inheritance.
