package Constructor_Chaning;

public class info {
//	A constructor chaining is nothing but call constructor from another constructor in same class.
//	its happen through inheritance.
//	
//	
//	When we creat the instance of a  derived class,
//	All constructor of the inherited class (parent class/base class) firstly invoked,
//	after that constructor of derived class(child class)is invoked.
//	
//	main use of constructor chaning is avoid duplicate codes while having multiple codes ,
//	and provide readability.
//	
//	
//	Rules of constructor chaning:-
//	
//	1) this keyword is must be in first line in constructor.
//    2) order does not matter in constructor chaning
//    3) there must exist atleast one constructor which does not contain this keyword.
	
//	
//	How we achieve the constructor chaning:---->
	
//	1) within the same class
//          by using this keyword.
	
//    2) from parent class to child class
//         by using super keyword.
