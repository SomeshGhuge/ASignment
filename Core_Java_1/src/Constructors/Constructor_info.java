    //  Constructor- 
    //	It is the special method whose name is same as class name called as constructor.
    //It is invoked by JVM automatically when you create the object of class.
	//It does not return anything even void also.
	//It is used to initialize the object.
	//There are two types of constructor are as
	// 1) Default constructor(No- argument constructor)
	// 2) User defined constructor
	//  2A) Parameterized constructor(Argument constructor)
	//  2B) Non-parameterized constructor(No- argument constructor)
	
	
	// Why we use  the constructor---->if you want to execute some code at the time of object
	//creation.In other words,it is used for generally initialization of global variables.
