public class info {
//	 Polymorphism means one entity  that behaves differently in different cases.
//	 for example:- light butten  operate for on and off pupose.
//	there are two types of polymorphism
//	 1) method overtloading
//	 2) method overriding
//	
//  1) method overloading:-
//           same method name and different argument name  called method overloading
// it also known as method overloading,compile timee polymorphism,static binding,early binding.
//
//	Rules:-
//	  1) method name must be same 
//    2) argument name must be different(Data types,sequence of argument,no of arguments)
//    3) return type is anything 
//    4) access specifier is anything	
//
//    Why we use compile time polymorphism.....?
//    		Because it is decided at compile time which one method should get
//    		called thatâ€™s why it is called as compile time polymorphism.
	
	
	
	
//	2) Method overriding:-
//
//     same method name and same argument name called method overriding.
//     it is also known as method overriding,run time compilation,dynamic binding,late binding
//     need of superclass and sub class
//     
//Rules:
//	     1) method name and argument name must be same
//       2) return type must same or diff
//       3) access specifier		
	
//	Why we use method overriding:-
//	                           1) mentability
//	                           2) rediability of code
//
